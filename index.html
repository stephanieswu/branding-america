        <p >Branding aims to build recognition and trust with its audience , or in other words, to legitimize. A brand is a culmination of many pieces—from the name to logo to mission statement, all building towards giving identity or meaning to an entity. In theory everything can be branded including the water we drink and the food we consume. If anything can be branded, what about nations?  Place branding is the contemporary practice of marketing a city or a country. According to Peter van Ham, “a country’s brand is determined by its culture, political ideals, and policies.” aAlthough place branding is a useful framework for this study, I want to expand past its contemporary usages for tourism, market capitalism, and international relations , delving into the historical developments of how a nation is branded. <a href="https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/jaro2016/SOC757/um/61816961/Benedict_Anderson_Imagined_Communities.pdf" target="_blank"> Benedict Anderson’s definition of a nation is “an imagined political community — and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign”</a> It is limited because there is always a border containing a nation's territory and other nations lie beyond it. It is sovereign because the idea of a nation was born during the Enlightenment which rejected the notion of divine rule, therefore the modern nation-state emphasizes freedom and democracy. Lastly it is a community because “the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship” The nation-state is a relatively new concept in the timeline of human history, however it always tends to hold an “immemorial past”.<br><br>
        The United States serves as a prime case study of nation branding. Encompassing a deep history of colonialism, genocide, and slavery, the United States relies on symbols, rituals, myths to brand itself a new revisionist and nationalist history and as with the goal of every brand, to build trust with it’s consumers, or in this case, its population. The act of nation building within a settler colonial state entails the erasure and destruction of an Indigenous past, therefore not only do these symbols, rituals, and myths brand America, they also serve to delegitimize and obscure. This study aims to dissect how the United States is constructed through semiotics to build a brand that “radiates cultural superiority, political power, and military dominance” <br><br>
        Anderson points to print-capitalism as the primary vehicle for the development of the concept of a nation  due to its vernacularization of language and the spread of newspapers and novels to generate a communal understanding of other imagined members of the nation. As designers, we have a role to play in nation building and we have to decide if we want to continue to participate and in legitimizing  settler colonial nation-states  or subvert and expose these symbols as visuals of oppression. Chris Lee suggests that acts of resistance can be acts of “deliberate illiteracy” and I think in order to be purposely illiterate, you need to first understand the systems you are resisting against. Through my examples, I hope to articulate how America maintains and legitimizes it’s hegemonic power through  use of symbols and through how it can be resisted.<br><br>

            <p>The ubiquitous logo of America would be the flag. It evokes immediate recognition and numerous associations whether you’re American or not. Serving as an abstract map, it holds 50 stars for each state and 13 stripes for each of the pre-American Revolution colonies. It represents both the territorial past and present. As the logo of the United States, it’s a symbol and object expected to be respected—that is if you respect this nation. Similar to how legacy brands like Coca Cola have rebranded their logos overtime, so has the American flag. The creation of the flag is a myth itself, Betsy Ross is credited with sewing the first flag during the American Revolution but there is a lack of historical evidence of her doing so, yet she is upheld as the original designer. Additionally, there have been variations on the flag such as the Confederate, Blue Live Matter, and Trump flag reflecting the thin line between oppression and  patriotism.</p>

      <li><h5 style="font-family: 'Dela Gothic One', cursive;">2. The People's Flag Show </h5>
      <img src="https://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjM0NTgyMSJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA5MCAtcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MTQ0MFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=b0b5b791421ec8b0" alt="" >
      <p>The People’s Flag Show was hosted by Faith Ringgold, Jean Toche, and Jon Hendricks  in 1971 aimed to push the limitations of flag desecration laws. It was inspired by a lawsuit against a gallery owner, Stephen Radich, who displayed work with the flag. The People’s Flag Show was raided by the police but the charges against the artists were ultimately dropped. The key line in this poster I want to point out is “artists, workers, students, women, third world peoples-you are oppressed-what does this flag mean to you?”.</p></li>
      <li><h5 style="font-family: 'Dela Gothic One', cursive;">3. How To Burn An American Flag </h5>
        <a href="https://www.indigenousaction.org/how-to-burn-an-american-flag/" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.indigenousaction.org/wp-content/uploads/how-to-burn-an-american-flag-791x1024.jpg" alt="" ></a>
        <p>This is from <a href="indigenousaction.org" target="_blank">Indigenous Action</a>, “a radical volunteer crew of anti-colonial & anti-capitalist Indigenous media makers, designers, artists, writers & agitators that work together on a project by project basis for liberation for Mother Earth and all her beings.” They view burning the flag as a symbolic political act and a sign of protest. Since the flag is the logo of the United States, and therefore the face of the American brand, burning the flag will “break down the legitimacy of their power”—this is how to subvert these symbols which hold up the seemingly powerful American brand. </p>

        <p>This painting personified the concept of “Manifest Destiny” through an idealized blonde woman moving West and pulling lines, trains and carriages behind her symbolizing the spread of modernity. She radiates purity, rationality, and whiteness. In turn, this justified Western settler expansion. The phrase “Manifest Destiny” references that Americans had a divine right to the land they are taking. This is also exemplified by the glow emanating from her body and the group of Indigenous people on the left corner covered in shadow as if to say that American expansion will lift them out of the shadows, or uncivilization. Women tend to be the personifications of the nation; another example would be the Statue of Liberty. They often represent values of the nation and can be read as a category of American mascots. By using a women to represent expansion and especially the way she is depicted in this painting, it softens and masks the face that “Manifest Destiny” is another phrase of dispossession of Indigenous land and the continued genocide of Indigenous people.</div>
